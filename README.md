## 🎯 Project Details
**Brand Archetype: The Lover**

Our Choice: We chose "The Lover" archetype (as detailed in our research) to position our brand as premium, elegant, and aspirational.

Customer Segment: Our target audience is consumers who view clothing as a source of identity, confidence, and self-worth.

Implementation: The website's visual identity (elegant fonts, rich colors) and messaging ("Invest in your signature style") are designed to create an intimate and sophisticated emotional connection.

### Persuasion Method: Social Proof (Cialdini)
Our Choice: From our Cialdini research, we focused on "Social Proof" as the most effective principle for a clothing brand.

Implementation: We directly implemented this by building a dedicated `reviews.njk` page. This page is designed to build trust and confidence in new customers by showing them that others have purchased and enjoyed our products.
