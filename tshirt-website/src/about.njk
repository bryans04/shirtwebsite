  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>ComfyTees began with a simple idea — to make t-shirts that feel as good as they look. We believe comfort and sustainability should go hand in hand. Every shirt we make uses eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We are committed to reducing waste, supporting fair labor, and providing clothing that lasts. When you wear ComfyTees, you’re choosing comfort, style, and a better future for fashion.</p>
